# GNU Octave Language Grammar

Regular expression based grammar for the [GNU Octave](https://octave.org/) programming language

## Features

* Syntax highlighting

## Scope

The present repository aims to provide with an "official" syntax highlighting grammar for the GNU Octave programming language, so that it can be differentiated from MATLAB.

## Contributing

The goal is to make the syntax highlighting identical (or as similar as possible) to the default syntax highlighting used by the GNU Octave GUI Editor. Thus, any contributions are welcome. 

## Acknowledgements

The `Octave.tmLanguage` grammar file was written by [Andrew Janke](https://apjanke.net) for his VSCode extension project, which can be found at <https://github.com/apjanke/vscode-octave-hacking>. It was based on the original [TextMate Octave grammar](https://github.com/textmate/matlab.tmbundle/blob/2cdc1f841443e4bc8b94f42f5e86431b31e04387/Syntaxes/Octave.tmLanguage).
